# Tuos

Offers free online tools and services for the public.

# NOTICE

As of now This project haven't applied any coding standards nor any approach in terms of development and this project is purely experimental and may cause fatal damages if deployed on production. We intented to make our own coding standards for the project plugins so that it will be easier for everyone to create and apply their own plugin.

Tuos plugin standards and file structures are still undecided, so commits and push are expected to cause major changes.
